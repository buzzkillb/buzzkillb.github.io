After seeing how toxic bitcointalk has become I was curious what I was posting about when I first registered. Not shocking my 2nd post was a sample config on my best settings to mine litecoin with AMD 7950's. Those were the good old days where it wasn't just a bunch of numbskulls making things up as facts and hating on everything in their path. What happened to communities that werent so respulsive?
