Watching staking and taking some assumptions based on daily weight and how much I am staking myself I can come up with some very good ballpark numbers on daily emissions after block 3 million.  

With that said I am assuming on any given day 200,000 Denarius is being staked daily.

Using [https://pos.watch](https://pos.watch) we can then start taking percentages to figure out future daily emissions.  

`200000 / 7189340.71 = 2.78%`  

at 10% staking of the total circulating at block 3mil daily emissions would be 118.18  

`2.78% / 10% = .278`  

`.278 * 118.18 = 32.85 D/day`  

Fortunastakes get 33% of emissions  

`33% * 32.85 = 10.84 D` for currently 400 fortunstakes  

`10.84 / 400 = 0.0271 D per Fortunastake daily`  

This gives  

`66% * 32.85 = 21.68 D/day` for everyone else  

Current daily emissions are 5534 D/day. Notice what's about to happen right around the 3 year birthday of Denarius?
