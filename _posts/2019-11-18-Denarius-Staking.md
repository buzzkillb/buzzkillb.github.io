Roughly less than 100 days until denarius POW block rewards go to 0. This happens at block 3,000,000 and goes basically full PoS.  

I am mainly watching blocktimes, staking weight and how many fortunastakes are running. [https://denarius.pro](https://denarius.pro) has some nice grafana graphs to watch this.

Next I am watching the D/Block ratio as this is how much D is being generated per block based on the the last 2880 percentage of POW/PoS. We can also see how much D is left to mine until block 3million. Because of this, we can also see what dailly emissions are when POW is running compared to what expected daily emissions are after block 3 million. Some rough math is showing about 5500 D/day is being created. But doing some math that I will get into later I can estimate about 50 D/day daily emissions after block 3,000,000. Currently price is staying down as miners are daily dumping quite a bit of D weekly. But what happens when those emissions go to 1% of what's happening now? Lots of math to show in a later post.
