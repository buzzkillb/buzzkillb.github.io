## AMD Ryzen 7/7!!

The new AMD Ryzen is coming July 7th! Excited for this, though I really want the 3950x for those cores. If you have not done a compile on many cores, its amazing.  

An terrible comparison, was when I compiled the denarius QT wallet on a pi3 b+ and it takes about 4 hours. Now go over to the Threadripper 2950x on a make -j32 and it takes less than 30 seconds. The command line scrolls so fast it will give you a seizure.  

So why the 3950x then over my Threadripper running Ubuntu 16.04 server? The clock speed is increased, and I am hopeful that clock speed will also overclock a bit using PBO. Also this means I can use the 3950x as my main PC for a dual boot of Windows 10 and Ubuntu 19.04.  Then prepare for next gen Threadripper to run a faster server with more cores when those release.  

That's the plan. Though I am still waiting for the Pi4 to release here in the States so I can buy up a bunch of the 4gb model to run in a cluster and compare if I can get away with running slower many cores compared to that threadripper 2950x.  

Its been a long time since I was excited about multiple PC products coming out. And here we go, and havent even mentioned Intel in here. Which I bet should have some great stuff coming out to compete back with AMD.
