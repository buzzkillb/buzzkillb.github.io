Playing around in docker is a lot of fun. I started to look around if anyone had made a Bitcoin QT running inside. It was hard to find one that is simple and works, obviously some tweaking has to happen in between.  

What I learned is that Denarius is difficult to setup and compile, so once I can do something with D, I can figure it out very quickly for another cryptocurrency.  

Another benefit to running the QT wallet like this is that you do not need to mess with dependencies. Denarius wants openssl to downgrade, so instead of downgrading openssl on Ubuntu 19.04, I can just use an Ubuntu 16.04 container to build from.  

The basic run script is easy enough to run in Ubuntu 19.04. I can just bring my wallet.dat in and start up both QT's I made this for.
