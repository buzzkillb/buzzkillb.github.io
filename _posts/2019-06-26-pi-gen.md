Thinking about how to custom pi-gen a bit more to prepare for the cluster.  

While I think of ways to save time to image the cluster, it makes a lot of sense to try to get as much of the custom cluster stuff done in the initial raspbian image itself.  

I won't be using the prebuilt Denarius wallet daemon or QT, so I can fork my repo, and edit those out, and switch in whatever I am planning to add. For instance as a test installing docker and docker-compose.  

Then I also wait for buster to work right in this as well. Lots of tinkering, but if this takes me a couple months and eventually does what I need, I think I will save a good chunk of money compared to how I am currently running this setup.
